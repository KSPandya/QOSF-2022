# QOSF-2022
Solution to QOSF 2022 screening task (COHORT 5)

In this file, I have submitted my solution to Task 2 for the screening. The problem was to encode and classify the given dataset using various encoding strategies and ansatz in the variational circuit. Here, I have considered the following Embeddings and  Layers ( using Pennylane) - Amplitude Embedding, Angle Embedding , Basis Embedding(to selected columns), IQP4 Embedding and some hybrid Embedding techniques(combining multiple embeddings in a single strategy), followed by BasicEntanglerLayers, StronglyEntanglingLayers and RandomLayers.
